      Howdy! My name is Ben Hernandez and I proudly hail from the great
      state of Texas; pretty much born and raised. I was born in a tiny town
      on the Louisanna/Texas border called Groves. When I was six weeks old, my
      dad got a job in Pennsylvania and we moved up there. Eight years later,
      my parents were homesick for our great state and we moved back. I lived
      in Texas all the way until I moved to Denver 6 months ago. Denver was our
      family's goto vacation spot when I was a kid so when I finally got the
      guts to move away, I choose Denver.

          The first one represents how I felt going through some of these prework
          tutorials. Her face pretty much perfectly matches mine going through
          the web tutorials and not having access to my auto-complete. It felt
          like coding in the 90s.

          This other image represents how I think this program is going to feel
          sometimes. I am about to spend six months working with stuff I am
          unfamiliar with and I am going to fall and fail but the end is still
          going to be epic :)

    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a job</li>
      <li>Pay off loans</li>
      <li>Work for a startup</li>
      <li>Stack paper</li>

      I don't really have any long-term goals for the type of company I will
      work for. I am a casual stock-trader and just came from being a full-time
      teacher so I imagine that if I find anything in analytics or education,
      I would jump on it. I would also love to be somewhere where I can use my
      math degree as well.
